# Introduction #

This game was an inspired by my uncle Ziki El-Abed who is one of the best backgammon players in Toulouse, France and Tripoli, Lebanon.

It is based on a version of backgammon known as Plakoto aka Shesh Besh which has a layout where both sides start off with all their chips in the banks.
